# Feature Roadmap and Ideas

###
- Verifying database connectivity from the bridge agent to the database
- Improvements to Bridge log viewer
- Use Einstein GPT to quickly summarize, analyze and troubleshoot bridge logs. (we have prototyped using LLM GPTs to parse and summarize log files which works quite well)
- Pre-defined filters to identify most interesting logs
- Enable support for File based datasources: Map local mount in linux container to a UNC path for example \\fileserver\folder\myexcel.xlsx using samba during bridge image creation.
- Customer has ability to configure their bridge agents to upload bridge logs to their own splunk or cloudwatch instance.
- Improved styling of Web user interface
- Improved support for multiple tableau cloud Tenants and Sites
- Improved integration with DataConnect for building and publishing container base image with drivers to DataConnect registry.
- Idea: Add support for building and deploying Tableau Server container images
